# **YourTube - A YouTube Clone using Google Developer API and Java Servlets**

Welcome to **YourTube**, a project that brings you a simple, personalized video streaming experience, similar to YouTube! üöÄ

This project is built using the Google Developer API and Java Servlets to fetch video data, display it in a user-friendly interface, and offer an experience that's *almost* like the real thing, but with a personal touch. üòé

### **üîß How to Set Up the Project**

To run **YourTube** locally, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourtube.git
    cd yourtube
    ```

2. **Set up the Google Developer API**:
   - Go to the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).
   - Create a new project and enable the **YouTube Data API v3** for your project.
   - Get your **API Key** and place it in the `web.xml` or an appropriate configuration file in your project (make sure to keep it secure).

3. **Setup Java Servlets**:
   - Ensure you have **Java 8** (or later) installed on your system.
   - You can use **Apache Tomcat** or another servlet container to run your Java Servlets.
   - Build the project (use `mvn clean install` if you're using Maven).

4. **Run the Application**:
    - Start the Tomcat server or any servlet container you prefer.
    - Visit `http://localhost:8080/yourtube` in your browser to see YourTube in action.

### **üõ† Technologies Used**

- **Google Developer API**: For fetching video data and interacting with the YouTube platform.
- **Java Servlets**: Used to handle HTTP requests and responses to serve dynamic content.
- **HTML/CSS/JS**: For front-end development, creating a user-friendly interface.
- **JSP (JavaServer Pages)**: To dynamically generate HTML content on the server-side.

### **üîë Authentication and API Usage**

1. You will need a valid **API Key** from the Google Developer Console to use the YouTube Data API. Insert this key in the configuration section of your project (usually in `web.xml` or a separate properties file).

2. If you'd like to implement authentication with Google to get more personalized data (such as subscribing to channels or saving preferences), you can integrate the **OAuth 2.0** flow using Google's API Client Library for Java.
